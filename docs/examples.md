# A Few Things to Try Out for Yourself

Here are a few practical examples to help you understand and customize the TEA model.

As you're going through the examples - it's extremely important to critically think about the numbers that results. If it doesn't make sense, if it's unintuitive, or if it's a surprise - use it as an opportunity to follow the trail and understand where the difference is coming from.  

When doing these mini analyses, you can create a 'peek' section to quickly see the impact without jumping between sheets all the time.

## Available Examples

Here are the examples you can explore:

1. [Sensitivity Analysis on Bioleach Recovery Rate](examples/cust_bioleach.md) - Learn how to test different recovery rates and observe their impact on the model.

2. [What if microbes, acid, inputs were free?](examples/cost_assmpt.md) - Explore how changing cost assumptions affects the overall economics.

3. [Add a Unit Operation](examples/add_unit_op.md) - Follow a step-by-step guide to add a new unit operation to the process flow.

4. [Add a Sensitivity](examples/add_sensitivity.md) - Learn how to add new sensitivity parameters to the model for customized analyses.

Choose an example to get started, or work through them in sequence to build your understanding of the model.

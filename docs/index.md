# Orecast Project: Chalcopyrite TEA Guide

Welcome to our supporting documentation for the Chalcopyrite Heap Leach TEA, part of [Homeworld](https://www.homeworld.bio/)'s Orecast project and a collaboration with [Conductor Labs](https://www.conductor-labs.com/). 

You can find the model linked [here](https://1drv.ms/x/c/147876eee33501b9/EQPpl4ljGOJMrgbxcQLHN2UB-NKCfIsGOYR3Qath6lANzw?e=WHnI8g).

## About This Documentation

This guide provides detailed instructions for using the Chalcopyrite Heap Leach Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA) tool. The TEA is designed to help scientists, innovators, researchers, and industry professionals understand the economic implications of biological interventions in copper mining processes.
